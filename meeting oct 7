NEW PLAN;
Kinect sensor situated on top of install
blob detection to tell where ppl stand when ppl stand for longer then predtermined amount of second local area of vegitation dies
once person moves, vegetation goes back to life
everytime veg death is triggered we incriment a counter
when counter exceeds a number we drop ink into the water
once water overflows we detect with moisture sensor and turn it off
